# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Knowledge Base UI

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The Knowledge Base UI is designed to help users quickly find articles related to a topic or idea, and to discover new relationships between articles. The interface will support full-text and keyword search, filtering, and intuitive navigation between articles using Obsidian-style keyword links. The goal is to facilitate exploration, idea generation, and knowledge discovery in a visually engaging, 80s retro terminal-inspired interface built with FastHTML.

## 2. Goals

- Enable users to rapidly search for and find articles by topic, keyword, or full text.
- Allow users to filter search results by metadata (e.g., tags, date, author).
- Provide a clear, readable view of article metadata and content.
- Support navigation between related articles via clickable links, with a back button for easy return.
- Suggest new ideas or questions based on the current article or search context.
- Deliver a visually appealing 80s retro terminal UI using FastHTML.

## 3. User Stories

- As a user, I want to search for articles by keyword or full text so I can quickly find relevant information.
- As a user, I want to filter articles by metadata so I can narrow down results to what matters to me.
- As a user, I want to click on keywords or links in an article to see related articles and discover new connections.
- As a user, I want to easily return to previous articles using a back button so I don't lose my place.
- As a user, I want the UI to suggest new ideas or questions based on what I'm reading to inspire further exploration.
- As a user, I want the interface to feel like an 80s retro terminal for a fun and nostalgic experience.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1. The system must provide a search page with a text input for full-text and keyword search.
2. The system must support filtering search results by metadata fields (e.g., tags, date, author).
3. The system must display a list of articles matching the search/filter criteria, sorted by relevance.
4. The system must display article metadata at the top and the content below in a clear, readable format.
5. The system must render keywords or links in articles as clickable elements.
6. Clicking a keyword/link must show a list of related articles, sorted by strongest match.
7. The system must provide a back button to return to the previous article or search result.
8. The system must suggest new ideas or questions related to the current article or search context.
9. The UI must use FastHTML and follow an 80s retro terminal visual style (e.g., green/amber text, monospace font, dark background, blinking cursor effect).

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- User authentication or personalized accounts.
- Article editing or creation from the UI.
- Real-time collaboration features.
- Mobile-specific UI optimizations (desktop-first design).

## 6. Design Considerations

- Use FastHTML for all UI rendering.
- Emulate 80s retro terminal style: dark background, green/amber text, monospace font, boxy UI elements, blinking cursor, etc, while supporting highlighting in a few colors for readability and navigation.
- Ensure accessibility (sufficient contrast, keyboard navigation).
- Layout: search/filter panel, results list, article view with metadata at the top, content below, and navigation controls (back button, suggestions).
- The UI should support deep-linking/bookmarking of specific articles or searches.

## 7. Technical Considerations

- Integrate with the existing knowledge base backend for search, filtering, and article retrieval.
- Use FastHTML components for all UI elements.
- Ensure efficient handling of large result sets (pagination or lazy loading if needed).
- Suggestion engine may use simple keyword matching or leverage existing AI/ML modules if available.
- Suggestions for new ideas/questions should be AI-generated.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Users can find and open a relevant article within 3 clicks or less.
- Users can navigate to at least one related article from any article view.
- At least 80% of users report the UI as "easy to use" and "visually engaging" in feedback.
- System uptime and responsiveness meet project standards (e.g., <500ms response time for search/navigation actions).

## 9. Open Questions

- Are there any specific metadata fields that must be supported for filtering?
- Are there any accessibility requirements beyond basic contrast and keyboard navigation?
